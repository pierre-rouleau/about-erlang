There are an increasing number of tools available for Erlang development.
Some of them are listed in this page.

ðŸš§ This page is under construction.  I will add  info about several other
tools soon. ðŸš§

rebar3
======

For Erlang projects you must use this tool.  It's used in Erlang but also
other BEAM-based languages.  It is used for several tasks and controls the
build of Erlang projects.

See:

- `rebar3 @ GitHub`_
- `rebar home page`_   (you can download a copy of rebar from this page),
- `rebar3 documentation`_
- `rebar3 tutorials`_

To start from the beginning, read `rebar3 Getting Started`_

elvis - the Erlang Style Reviewer
=================================

See:

- `elvis @ Github`_
- `elvis video presentation by Inaka and Erlang Solutions on Youtube`_

To use elvis, start by creating a git clone the `elvis Github repo`_ on your
computer. Then follow the instructions listed in the repo Readme file which
essentially consist of running the following commands inside your elvis
clone directory:

- ``rebar3 compile``
- ``rebar3 escriptize``

The second command creates an ``elvis`` executable in the ``_build/default/bin``
sub-directory. You can then create a symlink to that file in a directory that
is in your PATH to be able to invoke the elvis command from anywhere.

On my system I use the ``~/bin`` directory for that purpose.

With the above done, you will be able to execute elvis from the command line
like this:

::

    > elvis
    Usage: elvis [-h] [-c <config>] [--commands]
                 [--output-format <output_format>] [-P <parallel>] [-q] [-V]
                 [-v] [-p <code_path>] [-k]

      -h, --help          Show this help information.
      -c, --config        Provide the path to the configuration file. When
                          none is provided elvis checks if there's an
                          elvis.config file.
      --commands          Show available commands.
      --output-format     It allows you to display the results in plain text.
                          When none is provided elvis displays the results in
                          colors. The options allowed are (plain | colors |
                          parsable).
      -P, --parallel      Allows to analyze files concurrently. Provide max
                          number of concurrent workers, or specify "auto" to
                          peek default value based on the number of schedulers.
      -q, --quiet         Suppress all output.
      -V, --verbose       Enable verbose output.
      -v, --version       Output the current elvis version.
      -p, --code-path     Add the directory in the code path.
      -k, --keep-rocking  Won't stop rocking on first error when given a list
                          of files


    > elvis --commands
    Elvis will do the following things for you when asked nicely:

    rock [file...]   Rock your socks off by running all rules to your source files.

    git-hook         Pre-commit Git Hook: Gets all staged files and runs the rules
                                          specified in the configuration to those
                                          files.

    git-branch [branch|commit]
                     Rock your socks off by running all rules on source files that
                     have changed since branch or commit.

    install git-hook
                    Installs Elvis as a pre-commit hook in your current working
                    directory, which should be a git repository.
    >

Next you will have to configure elvis.  See Elvis repo documentation for that.
