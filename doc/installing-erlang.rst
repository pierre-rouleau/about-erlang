Erlang can be installed from source or from pre-built packages.

Instruction on how to install Erlang depends on the Operating System and are
available on the `Erlang OTP Download page`_.  Another good source of
information is available in the `setup section of the Adopting Erlang`_ web site.

The following section describes the various ways to install Erlang on macOS.


.. _setup section of the Adopting Erlang: https://adoptingerlang.org/docs/development/setup/

Installing Erlang on macOS
==========================

To install Erlang on your macOS system you can use one of the following ways:

#. `Using Homebrew`_, the simplest to get going, but also the least flexible way.
   A good first step for experimentation.
#. `Using Erlang Installer from Erlang Solutions`_.  With Erlang Solutions'
   ``ErlangInstaller`` macOS native application you can quickly install
   pre-built versions of Erlang for macOS and select which one you want to
   use.  I provide extra information on how to extends this.
#. `Using Kerl`_ to build from source code using clones of the official Erlang
   git repositories.
#. `Using asdf-vm`_ to build from source.  asdf-vm extends Kerl and provide
   the ability to build lots of other tools, Elixir for instance.
   At the moment (and from what I currently know) this seems to be a very good
   choice because you can install Erlang but also Elixir and several other
   tools with it.
#. Building from source using the Erlang/OTP instructions found in
   the `Erlang/OTP Build and Install instructions`_. I have not yet gone
   through the entire process yet. Once I do I will provide more information.


Also, see the section titled
`Manual installation of Erlang OTP Documentation and Man Files`_
to get a local copy of Erlang HTML documentation and Erlang Man pages.

Some extra information specific to macOS is available of my `macOS Development Environment`_ document.

See `Install Erlang OTP Documentation and Man Files`_.


Using Kerl
----------

If you want to build Erlang from source easily, you can use Kerl_.  This tool
is a shell script that controls the build.  It attempts to be shell agnostic
and requires only ``curl`` and ``git`` as dependencies.

On macOS, to use Kerl, you also need XCode_ and a recent version of OpenSSL_.
The OpenSSL_ version that is available on macOS is outdated.
The easiest way to install a more recent version of OpenSSL_ on macOS is to use
`Homebrew`_ with ``brew install openssl``.

When building Erlang with Kerl (and asdf-vm) you can use the default macOS
C/C++ toolchain part of Xcode, which is Apple's own version of the Clang
compiler suite, or you can also install GCC or the LLVM Clang compiler
suites. I have been able to build with the 3 suites.  However, I must have a
setup problem with my GCC 9 installation because builds with GCC 9 fail to
produce an Erlang debugger that works.  I've had no problem with the Apple
native compiler nor with LLVM 10.

Depending on what you have on your system, you may have to install other tools
to perform the build with Kerl.  You might need to install GNU Make for
instance.  Use Homebrew to install those tools.

Setting the environment for Kerl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use Kerl you need to set several shell environment variables.  The
instructions provided by the Kerl home page describe what to add to your shell
setup.  Instead of doing that I the same strategy and create a shell script to
install the environment along with a shell alias to invoke it.

I use the following ``envfor-kerl`` bash script:

.. code:: bash

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    # Abstract: setup shell to build Erlang with Kerl.
    # Last Modified Time-stamp: <2020-07-05 12:29:17, updated by Pierre Rouleau>

    if [ "$ROUP_FOR_BUILDING_ERLANG" == "" ]; then
        export ROUP_FOR_BUILDING_ERLANG=$PATH
        SSL_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/openssl@1.1/1.1.1g/
        export KERL_BUILD_BACKEND="git"
        export KERL_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS="--without-javac --with-dynamic-trace=dtrace --with-ssl=${SSL_PATH}"
        export KERL_BUILD_DOCS=yes
        export KERL_INSTALL_MANPAGES=yes
        export KERL_INSTALL_HTMLDOCS=yes
        use-gmake
    else
        printf "Shell is already setup for building Erlang!\n"
        return 1
    fi
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------


This uses another source script: ``envfor-gmake``, invoked via the
``use-gmake`` alias:

.. code:: shell

    #!/bin/sh
    # Abstract: Install latest GNU Make as the main make in the current shell.

    # This GNU Make is the latest, and replaces the old GNU Make
    # distributed on macOS (GNU Make 3.81 from 2006)
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    if [ "$ROUP_USING_GMAKE" == "" ]; then
        export ROUP_USING_GMAKE=$PATH
        export PATH="/usr/local/opt/make/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
        printf "Now using the Homebrew-installed GNU Make in this shell\n"
        gmake --version
        printf "\n"
    else
        printf "GNU GMAKE is already installed in this shell!\n"
        printf "The original path is inside ROUP_USING_GMAKE\n"
        return 1
    fi
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 2 aliases I have in my ``.bashrc`` file for these are the following:

.. code:: bash

    alias use-kerl='source envfor-kerl'
    alias use-gmake='source envfor-gmake'

Kerl Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Kerl_ home page describes Kerl commands.  When building Erlang with Kerl,
you use Kerl to get a list of all available Git repositories with Erlang
source code,  clone a Erlang source git repository for the Erlang version you
want to build, build the Erlang version and optionally provide a different
name to recognize it when you have special build setups, and then install the
built Erlang version inside a directory tree, ready to be used.

The important Kerl commands are the following:

- kerl update releases
- kerl build {release} {build name}
- kerl install {build name} {target path}

  - kerl install 21.3 ~/bin/erls/21.3/

And then to activate a specific version of Erlang you source the corresponding
activate script located in the directory where you installed Kerl builds (in
this example this directory is ``~/bin/erls``):

.. code:: bash

   . ~/bin/erls/21.3/activate


Example: Building Erlang 19.3.6.13
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Below you can see the commands use to:

- setup a new shell with Kerl: ``use-kerl``,
- use Kerl to list all available Erlang versions: ``kerl update releases``,
- use Kerl to build Erlang 19.3.6.13: ``kerl build 19.3.6.13 19.3.6.13``,
- use Kerl to install Erlang 19.3.6.13 in ~/bin/erls: ``kerl install 19.3.6.13
  ~/bin/erls/19.3.6.13n``.

For this build I do not have Java tools available, so the build did not create
Erlang's JInterface.

Kerl Directory Layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kerl stores its files inside the ``~/.kerl`` directory tree.  The directory
holds 3 files (otp_builds, otp_installations and otp_releases) and 2 sub-directories
(archives and builds).

.. code:: shell

    > tree -L 1 -A .kerl
    .kerl
    âââ archives
    âââ builds
    âââ otp_builds
    âââ otp_installations
    âââ otp_releases

    2 directories, 3 files
    >

The ``~/.kerl/archives`` stores the compressed tarballs of downloaded Erlang
archives and the ``~/.kerl/builds`` hold the Erlang builds but not in a layout
ready for execution).  Here's the layout at 3 directory level deep taken
after building 19.3.6.13

Looking at ``~/bin/erls`` at 2 directory level deep, we can see that some builds include the man

Launching a shell with a Kerl-built Erlang
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I previously built Erlang 23.0.2 using the exact same method described above.
That build was using the macOS native compiler toolchain.  I created a shell
script called ``envfor-erlang-23-kn`` to setup a shell with that version of
Erlang and by ``.bashrc`` file has the alias ``use-erlang-23-kn`` to source
that script.

Here's the script:

.. code:: bash

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    # Abstract: Install Erlang 23.0.2 (built with Kerl/native Clang)
    # Last Modified Time-stamp: <2020-07-03 11:55:38, updated by Pierre Rouleau>
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # This file *must* be sourced.
    #
    # Run with: use-erlang-23-kn
    #
    #
    # It uses Kerl activate to install Erlang 23.0.2

    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    if [ "$DIR_ERLANG_DEV" == "" ]; then
        export DIR_ERLANG_DEV="$HOME/dev/erlang"
        MANPATH=$HOME/docs/Erlang/otp-23.0/man/man:`manpath`
        export MANPATH
        echo "+ Erlang 23.0.2 (built with Kerl/native Clang) environment set."
        echo "+ Using OTP-23 Man pages."
        echo "Use kerl_deactivate to deactivate it."
        settitle "Erlang 23.0.2 Kerl/Native"
        source ~/bin/erls/23.0.2/activate
    else
        echo "! Erlang environment was already set for this shell."
    fi

    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For 23.0.2 the Man pages were not part of the build, so the script sets up
``MANPATH`` to use the manually downloaded version of the OTP-23 man pages.

And the ``.bashrc`` aliases I have for Erlang built with Kerl and macOS native
compiler tool chain:

.. code:: shell

    # Kerl-built Erlang versions
    # - built with macOS native Clang
    alias use-erlang-23-kn='source envfor-erlang-23-kn'
    alias use-erlang-22-kn='source envfor-erlang-22-kn'
    alias use-erlang-19-kn='source envfor-erlang-19-kn'

Using asdf-vm
-------------

With the asdf-vm_ tool, you can "*manage multiple runtime versions with a
single CLI tool*" (as written on the asdf-vm_ site).
You can build, install and activate multiple versions of
Erlang as well as a lot of other things like Elixir and other un-related
programming languages and tools.  To asdf-vm, Erlang, like Elixir and Python
is a *plugin*. The concept of *plugin* here applies to a programming language,
or a specific tool. They are considered at the same level.

The asdf tool does everything.  With it you can list the various languages
that you want to use, their versions, and install them on the system very
easily.  When *installing* a version of a tool, it downloads the source code
and perform the complete build.

On my system I did not have to setup the version of OpenSSL to use with
asdf-vm as I had to do with Kerl.  asdf was able to detect the latest version
of OpenSSL I have on my system (as of this writing, version 1.1.1g released
April 21, 2020).

.. _asdf-vm: https://asdf-vm.com/#/
.. _Get and manage asdf -vm itself: https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-asdf-vm

.. _Get, compile and install a specific version of the plugin.:  https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-versions
.. _identify a current version: https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-versions?id=set-current-version

Setting the Environment for asdf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For asdf-vm_ I wrote the ``use-asdf`` alias to the ``envfor-asdf`` script that
it sources.

The ``envfor-asdf`` script is shown here:

.. code:: bash

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    # Abstract: Install asdf into a shell : tool to build/manage Erlang, Elixir, Ruby, NodeJs
    # Last Modified Time-stamp: <2020-07-03 14:35:47, updated by Pierre Rouleau>
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # This file *must* be sourced.
    #
    # Run with: use-asdf
    #
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # References:

    #
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    if [ "$ROUP_ENVFOR_ASDF" == "" ]; then
        export ROUP_ENVFOR_ASDF=1
        export KERL_BUILD_DOCS=yes
        export KERL_INSTALL_MANPAGES=yes
        export KERL_INSTALL_HTMLDOCS=yes
        . $(brew --prefix asdf)/asdf.sh
        . $(brew --prefix asdf)/etc/bash_completion.d/asdf.bash
        printf "ASDF support now installed in this shell.\n"
        printf "ASDF uses "
        $(brew --prefix openssl)/bin/openssl version
        settitle "Using ASDF"
    else
        printf "Shell is already setup for ASDF!\n"
        return 1
    fi
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------


The alias in my ``.bashrc`` file is:

.. code:: shell

  alias use-asdf='source envfor-asdf'


Then, to install a new version of Erlang using asdf_vm_,  the important steps are:

#. Set the shell for asdf-vm_ by executing the ``use-asdf`` alias to the
   ``envfor-asdf`` script it sources.
#. `Get and manage asdf -vm itself`_.  These are the instructions to install
   and manage asdf-vm.  You have to do this the very first time and then only
   when you want tu upgrade asdf-vm_ itself.
#. `List available plugins, get the ones you need, manage them.`_  You can
   list all available plugins (such as Erlang) and all versions available for
   this *plugin*.  So you can list all Erlang versions you can build with it.
#. `Get, compile and install a specific version of the plugin.`_  These are
   the commands you use to build and install something like a version of Erlang.


Once this is all done and you have compiled and installed one or several
versions of a given *plugin* (sucha as Erlang)  it's possible to `identify a current version`_ of a given
plugin to be used globally (it persists).  You can also use a command to
activate that version just for the current shell.

On my system I use the mechanism that activates a specific version of Erlang
for the shell using the same mechanism as I do for the other 3 ways of dealing
with Erlang: a ``use-erlang-xx-a`` alias defined in the ``.bashrc`` file to a
shell script it sources.  The shell script has a name like
``envfor-erlang-xx-a``.  The ``xx`` is Erlang version number and the ``-a``
suffix identifies thet asdf-vm toolchain.


asdf commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The asdf commands must be installed in the shell.  For that I execute my
``use-asdf`` alias to source my ``envfor-asdf`` script.  Once done, you can
use all asdf commands to:

- `update asdf-vm`_
- `manage asdf plugins`_
- `manage asdf plugins versions`_ (eg. build and install new versions of Erlang).

More information is available on the asdf-vm_ site.


.. _update asdf-vm: https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-asdf-vm
.. _manage asdf plugins: https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-plugins
.. _manage asdf plugins versions: https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-versions




Example: Building Erlang 22.3.4.2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here I build 2 different versions of Erlang with asdf-vm_: Erlang 23.0.2 and
22.3.4.2 with the following commands.

First I set the environment:

- ``use-asdf``

Then I check what is available:

- ``asdf plugin list``
- ``asdf plugin update --all``
- ``asdf list all erlang``

I perform the 2 builds:

- ``asdf install erlang 23.0.2``
- ``asdf install erlang 22.3.4.2``

And list the Erlang versions I have built with asdf-vm_ so far.

- ``asdf list erlang``

The asdf_vm_ can identify a version of each *plugin* as being the global
current version.  I list them with the following command and see that I did
not set any since I use a shell script to do that .  However, to have the
version used automatically on system startup you would probably want to
identify a global current version.

- ``asdf current``

At the end of asdf build, asdf removes the build log file.  There might be an
option to keep it, but I have been too lazy to look for it.  Instead, if I
want to look into the log I use Emacs and open the log file in auto-revert
mode.  I can then watch the build and save a copy somewhere.

.. note::  You may be interested by my `PEL project`_ which describes lots of Emacs commands
           in extensive PDF table files and provide an Emacs system that minimizes the
           need to know Emacs Lisp. See the `PEL File Management PDF table`_ for info on the
           auto-revert mode command.

Running Erlang built with asdf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I use the same strategy as for the others.
In my ``.bashrc`` vile I have aliases to source the shell scripts I need:

.. code:: shell

    # Erlang, Elixir, Ruby, NodeJs : ASDF shell
    # -----------------------------------------
    alias use-asdf='source envfor-asdf'
    alias use-erlang-21-a='source envfor-erlang-21-a'
    alias use-erlang-22-a='source envfor-erlang-22-a'
    alias use-erlang-23-a='source envfor-erlang-23-a'

The script ``envfor-erlang-23-a`` installs Erlang 23.0.2 built with asdf-vm_.
Here's the script:

.. code:: bash

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    # Abstract: Install Erlang 23.0.2 (built with asdf/native Clang)
    # Last Modified Time-stamp: <2020-07-05 09:26:34, updated by Pierre Rouleau>
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # This file *must* be sourced.
    #
    # Run with: use-erlang-23-a
    #
    #
    # This script uses:
    # - `use-asdf` alias to source the `envfor-asdf` script,
    # - `asdf` command to activate Erlang 23.0.2 locally.
    # - settitle script to set the terminal title.

    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    if [ "$DIR_ERLANG_DEV" == "" ]; then
        export DIR_ERLANG_DEV="$HOME/dev/erlang"
        MANPATH=$HOME/docs/Erlang/otp-23.0/man/man:`manpath`
        export MANPATH
        echo "+ Erlang 23.0.2 (built with asdf-vm/native Clang) environment set."
        echo "+ Using OTP-23 Man pages."
        echo "Note: asdf is leaving a .tool-version in the current directory!"
        use-asdf
        asdf local erlang 23.0.2
        settitle "Erlang 23.0.2a asdf/Native"
    else
        echo "! Erlang environment was already set for this shell."
    fi

    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

And here's a session using it to install Erlang 23.0.2:

    > asdf current

    > which erl

    > man -w lists
    /Users/roup/docs/Erlang/otp-23.0/man/man/man3/lists.3
    >

**A word of caution**

The asdf software stores the version of the tools used inside a file
called ``.tool-version`` inside the current directory where the asdf commands
were executed.  This can be quite useful: if you use several versions of
several tools you can create a directory that will be the current directory
where you will use all of these tool at the version specified inside the
file ``.tool-version``.  Once set up, open a shell, execute ``use-asdf`` and
then the version of the tool will be identified by the ``.tool-version`` file
stored in the current directory.  So **asdf is sensitive to the current
directory where the erl command is issued**.

Unlike the other tools (Erlang Solutions' Erlang Installer, Kerl-built
versions), you cannot use the same directory in 2 different shells and launch
2 different versions of Erlang, on in each shell.

It's possible to run multiple versions of Erlang at the same time, but they
must each be instantiated from a shell that has a different current directory.

With asdf  if you open 2 shells and execute ``use-erlang-23-a`` in the
first shell and then inside another shell execute ``use-erlang22-a`` in that
other shells, **from the same directory** both shells will now use the Erlang set up by
``use-erlang-22-a`` because they both use the same shim file identified by the
same ``.tool-version`` file.



asdf Directory Layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The directory used by asdf-vm is ``~/.asdf``.  The top directory contains no
files, it holds only sub-directories.  This is teh layout of this directory
tree shown with a depth of 3:

The ``~/.asdf/shims`` directory holds a set of script files that invoke the
real Erlang commands via an asdf command.

On my system I have installed some versions of Erlang and Elixir with asdf,
and the shims I see are shown here:

.. code:: shell


    > ls -F .asdf/shims
    cdv*                            elixirc*                        etop*                           snmpc*

The content of ``~/.asdf/shims/erl`` which is used to invoke the Erlang shell
is:

.. code:: bash

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    # asdf-plugin: erlang 21.3
    # asdf-plugin: erlang 23.0
    # asdf-plugin: erlang 22.3.3
    # asdf-plugin: erlang 22.3.4
    # asdf-plugin: erlang 23.0.2
    # asdf-plugin: erlang 22.3.4.2
    exec /usr/local/opt/asdf/bin/asdf exec "erl" "$@"

It uses asdf to execute the erl for the Erlang version identified by the
file .tool-versions stored in the current directory.

Creating whatis files for man pages
-----------------------------------




Erlang Man files to use with Emacs
----------------------------------

Emacs support for Erlang uses the Erlang man files.  Several packages uses the
Erlang man page files and they may install them in different location.
This section describes where various Emacs packages for Erlang support
install the man pages and how to consolidate them into one location.


Used by the standard Erlang mode (erlang.el)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The erlang.el stores only one version of the man files in
``~/.emacs.d/cache/erlang_mode_man_pages/`` directory.
The directory holds:

.. code:: ls

        -rw-r--r--  1 roup  staff    16239 17 Sep  2019 COPYRIGHT
        -rw-r--r--  1 roup  staff      842 17 Sep  2019 PR.template
        -rw-r--r--  1 roup  staff     4167 17 Sep  2019 README.md
        -rw-r--r--  1 roup  staff       51 22 Jul 10:32 erlang_man_download_url
        drwxr-xr-x  7 roup  staff      224 17 Sep  2019 man
        -rw-r--r--  1 roup  staff  1355169 22 Jul 07:44 man.tar.gz

Used by EDTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

EDTS stores the man pages of several Erlang versions inside a sub-directory of
``~/.emacs.d/edts/doc/`` identifying the version.  For example, the files for
Erlang version 23.0 are stored inside ``~/.emacs.d/edts/doc/23.0``.
The directory holds:

.. code:: ls

        -rw-r--r--   1 roup  staff  16239 12 May 17:41 COPYRIGHT
        -rw-r--r--   1 roup  staff    842 12 May 17:41 PR.template
        -rw-r--r--   1 roup  staff   4167 12 May 17:41 README.md
        drwxr-xr-x   7 roup  staff    224 12 May 17:30 man


Consolidating all Erlang Man Files in one location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As described above, you may install Erlang in various ways, with the file
stored in various locations depending on the method used to install a specific
version of Erlang.

Ideally, there would be a way to work on several projects *concurrently* even
if those projects use different versions of Erlang. Also, ideally, when using
Emacs, you'd want to be able to use the various Emacs tools for Erlang and
ensure they find the man files in their expected locations.

At the same time you'd want to be able to access Erlang Man files from the
shell using the man command and maintain only one copy for each Erlang
version.

If you are using Emacs, you'll notice several Emacs packages that support Erlang.
The erlang.el package supports on version of Erlang.  The edts package
supports multiple versions of Erlang.  And each of them have the ability to
download the Erlang man files and store them in a directory they control.

- The erlang.el package stores the erlang man page files inside the directory
  ``~/.emacs.d/cache/erlang_mode_man_pages/V``  where ``V`` is the Erlang
  version.
- The edts package stores the Erlang man page files inside the directory
  ``~/.emacs.d/edts/doc/VV`` where ``VV`` is the Erlang version.  There can be
  several ``VV`` directories, one per Erlang version supported.

Like I did, you may also have downloaded the Erlang man pages somewhere else
because you downloaded the entire Erlang source package and built Erlang
yourself, or because you are using an pre-built version of Erlang or for
whatever else reason.

One way to consolidate all of that is to use symbolic links.  What I did is
to place symlinks inside the edts directory to the locations where I stored
the Erlang man files.  In my case I stored all Erlang documentation files
inside the ``~/docs/Erlang`` directory which contains the entire documentation
tree of a each specific Erlang versions I am interested in.

For example, the man man files for Erlang 17.5 are stored inside
the directory ``~/docs/Erlang/otp-17.5/man``.  Here's a partial tree view
of the directory tree (I removed several lines for clarity):

.. code:: shell

    > tree -L 3 otp-17.5
    otp-17.5
    âââ html
    âââ man
    âÂ Â  âââ COPYRIGHT
    âÂ Â  âââ PR.template
    âÂ Â  âââ README
    âÂ Â  âââ erlang_man_download_url
    âÂ Â  âââ man
    âÂ Â      âââ man1
    âÂ Â      âââ man3
    âÂ Â      âââ man4
    âÂ Â      âââ man6
    âÂ Â      âââ man7
    âÂ Â      âââ whatis
    âââ readme.txt

    77 directories, 17 files
    >

Notice the ``erlang_man_download_url`` file.  This is a file created and used
by edts. It contains the URL where the man files can be downloaded.  The
file contains the following single line of text::

  https://erlang.org/download/otp_doc_man_17.5.tar.gz

Also notice the ``whatis`` file in the ``man`` directory.  I created that file
using the method explained in `Creating whatis files for man pages`_ to allow
me to restrict the man pages to Erlang only and take advantage of Emacs
completion using the Emacs man command.

Then I created the symlinks in the ``~/.emacs.d/edts/doc`` directory:

.. code:: shell


    > cd ~/.emacs.d/edts/doc
    > ln -s  /Users/roup/docs/Erlang/otp-22.3/man  22.3
    > ln -s  /Users/roup/docs/Erlang/otp-22.2/man  22.2
    > ln -s  /Users/roup/docs/Erlang/otp-21.3/man  21.3
    > ln -s  /Users/roup/docs/Erlang/otp-20.3/man  20.3
    > ln -s  /Users/roup/docs/Erlang/otp-19.3/man  19.3
    > ln -s  /Users/roup/docs/Erlang/otp-18.3/man  18.3
    > ln -s  /Users/roup/docs/Erlang/otp-17.5/man  17.5
    > ll

    lrwxr-xr-x  1 roup  staff  -  36 22 Jul 10:47 17.5@ -> /Users/roup/docs/Erlang/otp-17.5/man
    lrwxr-xr-x  1 roup  staff  -  36 22 Jul 10:47 18.3@ -> /Users/roup/docs/Erlang/otp-18.3/man
    lrwxr-xr-x  1 roup  staff  -  36 22 Jul 10:46 19.3@ -> /Users/roup/docs/Erlang/otp-19.3/man
    lrwxr-xr-x  1 roup  staff  -  36 22 Jul 10:46 20.3@ -> /Users/roup/docs/Erlang/otp-20.3/man
    lrwxr-xr-x  1 roup  staff  -  36 22 Jul 10:46 21.3@ -> /Users/roup/docs/Erlang/otp-21.3/man
    lrwxr-xr-x  1 roup  staff  -  36 22 Jul 10:45 22.2@ -> /Users/roup/docs/Erlang/otp-22.2/man
    lrwxr-xr-x  1 roup  staff  -  36 22 Jul 10:44 22.3@ -> /Users/roup/docs/Erlang/otp-22.3/man
    drwxr-xr-x  6 roup  staff  - 192 20 Jul 17:47 23.0/
    >

And then I create a symlink inside ``~/.emacs.d/cache`` called
``erlang_mode_man_pages`` to the location of the directory holding the man
pages of the default Erlang version for the shell.

Ideally that should be all controlled from the version of Erlang used in the
shell or in the project.   The edts package does some of this.  I'm planning
to wrap this all up with code controlled by my Emacs PEL system. But this is
still work in progress at the moment.
