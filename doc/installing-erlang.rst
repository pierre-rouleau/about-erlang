Erlang can be installed from source or from pre-built packages.

Instruction on how to install Erlang depends on the Operating System and are
available on the `Erlang OTP Download page`_.  Another good source of
information is available in the `setup section of the Adopting Erlang`_ web site.

The following section describes the various ways to install Erlang on macOS.

Installing Erlang on macOS
==========================

To install Erlang on your macOS system you can use one of the following ways:

#. `Using Homebrew`_, the simplest to get going, but also the least flexible way.
   A good first step for experimentation.
#. `Using Erlang Installer from Erlang Solutions`_.  With Erlang Solutions'
   ``ErlangInstaller`` macOS native application you can quickly install
   pre-built versions of Erlang for macOS and select which one you want to
   use.  I provide extra information on how to extends this.
#. `Using Kerl`_ to build from source code using clones of the official Erlang
   git repositories.
#. `Using asdf-vm`_ to build from source.  asdf-vm extends Kerl and provides
   the ability to build lots of other tools, Elixir for instance.
   At the moment (and from what I currently know) this seems to be a very good
   choice because you can install Erlang but also Elixir and several other
   tools with it.
#. Building from source using the Erlang/OTP instructions found in
   the `Erlang/OTP Build and Install instructions`_. I have not yet gone
   through the entire process yet. Once I do I will provide more information.

You will probably want to use Erlang man pages when developing code.
See the following sections:

- `Manual installation of Erlang OTP Documentation and Man Files`_
  to get a local copy of Erlang HTML documentation and Erlang Man pages,
- `Creating whatis files for Erlang man pages`_ to understand the purpose
  of the whatis utility and its impact on the Erlang man pages, and
- `Using Erlang Man files within Emacs`_ to get the best of Erlang when using Emacs.
- `Using Specialized OS Shells for Erlang`_, to use several versions of Erlang
  simultaneously.
- `Using PEL with Specialized Shells for Erlang to Edit Erlang`_.

The next step is to setup files that are important when using Erlang.
These files are described in the following sections.

- The ~/.erlang startup file


Some extra information specific to macOS is available of my `macOS Development Environment`_ document.

If you are not familiar with Emacs and would like to learn about it, you may
be interested by my Emacs customization and document project, PEL_ and the
Erlang specific document `Developing Erlang with PEL`_.
